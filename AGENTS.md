# Agentiz development notes

- Run the server with `npm run dev` (TSX).
- Run `npm run build` after TypeScript changes.
- Local application layers: `layers/app-agentiz` and `layers/app-agentiz-gitlab-integration`.
- A new layer must be added to `tsconfig.json` **and** `tsconfig.runtime.json` includes — tsx only
  applies `experimentalDecorators` to files matched by the runtime config, otherwise the app fails
  to load with "Decorators are not valid here".
- Layers talk to each other through app-manager collections (`@Collection` / `@CollectionHandler`),
  not direct imports — see `notes/app-layers/` before adding a cross-layer extension point.
- `adminizerMiddlewares` routes are always prefixed with Adminizer's `routePrefix` (`/dashboard`).
  A machine-facing API must be mounted on `this.appManager.app` in `mount()` instead — that is why
  the Worker API lives in `layers/app-agentiz/lib/workerApiRouter.ts`.
- Two separate collections own the two halves of "external system": `gitProviders` (where code
  lives) and `taskManagers` (where tasks come from). A project can mix them freely.
- Shared mutable registries must live on a `Symbol.for` global: under tsx a module can be
  instantiated twice (ESM + CJS graphs) and plain module state silently splits in two.
- Keep documentation specific to Agentiz in `notes/` (a local symlink, not tracked).
- Do not commit or publish changes unless explicitly requested.
